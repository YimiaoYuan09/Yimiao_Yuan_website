My name is Yimiao Yuan (Linda). 

I am a third year Engineering Science student studying at the University of Toronto, majoring in Machine Intelligence. I am currently doing my PEY at Xero as an intern data engineer.

During my academic career, I managed to accrue 4 months of working experience. I had the privilege of working for the University of Toronto in a research lab during the summer, where I learned valuable professional skills such as experimental design and research and development. 

Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven critical thinking, organizational, communication, and technical skills such as Python, Java, C, SQL, R, Verilog, Matlab, Machine Learning Models and Algorithms.
